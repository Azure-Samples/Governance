## Running the sample

1. Download the sample Azure portal dashboard definition file
   (`resourcegraphexplorer-sample-2.json`).

1. In Azure portal, select **Dashboard** from the left pane.

1. Select **Upload**, then locate and select the downloaded sample dashboard file. Then select
   **Open**.

The imported dashboard is automatically displayed. Since it now exists in your Azure portal, you may
explore and make changes as needed or create new dashboards from the example to share with your
teams. For more information about working with Azure portal dashboards, see
[Create and share dashboards in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards).
